## **Notes on Code Usage**  
Some parts of this code were copied from other sources and generated using ChatGPT. Any directly copied code is explicitly noted within the code. However, sections written with ChatGPT's assistance are not specifically marked. **To avoid any copyright issues, assume the entire code was developed with the help of ChatGPT.**  


## **Project Structure**  

### **Main Script**  
- **`main.py`** – Main program to run the experiments for Llama 3.2 3B. To run it for Llama 3.1 8B comment out lines 52-85 and use lines 86-126 instead.  

### **Task & Feature Relevance Analysis**  
- **`LLM_Tasks.py`** – Generates tasks for the LLMs.  
- **`Relevance_Maps.py`** – Computes relevance maps.  
- **`Prediction_Model.py`** – Runs and evaluates feature relevance in a model.  

### **Probing & Interventions**  
- **`Probing.py`** – Runs probing experiments.  
- **`Interventions.py`** – Performs intervention analysis.  
- **`Intervention_Model.py`** – Runs the model for intervention analysis.  

### **Results & Visualization**  
- **`Generate_Result_Graphics.py`** – Generates graphs.  

### **Helper Modules**  
- **`captum_helper.py`** – Overwrites Captum’s original code (fixing functionality issues).  
- **`Prediction_Helpers.py`** – Helper functions for `Relevance_Maps.py` and `Probing.py`.  
- **`TimeMeasurer.py`** – Provides time predictions for experiments.  

### **DAS Experiment** 
- **`DAS_Experiment.py`** – Main program to run the DAS experiments for Llama 3.2 3B for linear regression. To run it for manhattan distance change line 101 from "Task\_1=LLM\_Tasks.Regression\_Task\_Int(" to "Task\_1=LLM\_Tasks.Manhattan\_Distance\_Problem\_Int(".


### **Results** 
- **`results_Llama_3.2_3B`** – Includes all results for the Llama 3.2 3B as generated by "Generate_Result_Graphics.py"
- **`results_Llama_3.2_3B`** – Includes all results for the Llama 3.2 8B as generated by "Generate_Result_Graphics.py"

To reproduce the results from my experiment pipeline in the report, run:  
```bash
python main.py
```


## **Running DAS Experiment**  
To reproduce the results from the DAS Experiment mentioned in the appendix run:  
```bash
python DAS_Experiment.py
```
