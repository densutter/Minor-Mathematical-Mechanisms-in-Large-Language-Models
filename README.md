However, sections written with ChatGPT's assistance are not specifically marked. **To avoid any copyright issues, assume the entire code was developed with the help of ChatGPT.**  

## **Running the Experiment Pipeline**  
To reproduce the results from my experiment pipeline in the report, run:  
```bash
python main.py
```

## **Project Structure**  

### **Main Script**  
- **`main.py`** – Main program to run the experiments.  

### **Task & Feature Relevance Analysis**  
- **`LLM_Tasks.py`** – Generates tasks for the LLMs.  
- **`Relevance_Maps.py`** – Computes relevance maps.  
- **`Prediction_Model.py`** – Runs and evaluates feature relevance in a model.  

### **Probing & Interventions**  
- **`Probing.py`** – Runs probing experiments.  
- **`Interventions.py`** – Performs intervention analysis.  
- **`Intervention_Model.py`** – Runs the model for intervention analysis.  

### **Results & Visualization**  
- **`Generate_Result_Graphics.py`** – Generates graphs from interim results.  

### **Helper Modules**  
- **`captum_helper.py`** – Overwrites Captum’s original code (fixing functionality issues).  
- **`Prediction_Helpers.py`** – Helper functions for `Relevance_Maps.py` and `Probing.py`.  
- **`TimeMeasurer.py`** – Provides time predictions for experiments.
